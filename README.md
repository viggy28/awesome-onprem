# awesome-onprem
A list of companies that use on-premise infrastructure heavily

# Why is this list?
I understand many people want to work on the latest and the greatest services by the big3 [AWS, GCP and Azure] cloud providers. However, I have found it more interesting in working with companies that host their own data center and use internal tools, and open-source solutions. Maybe I am biased because I am a SRE 😉. If you are like me in the same boat, please do contribute.
